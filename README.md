Description: Describes the purpose of the template, which is to deploy EventBridge and SQS.

Resources
MySqsQueue: Defines an SQS queue.

MyEventRule: Defines an EventBridge rule with a custom event source ("custom.event") and a target that sends events to the SQS queue.

Outputs
SQSqueueName: Outputs the name of the SQS queue.

SQSqueueARN: Outputs the ARN of the SQS queue.

**GitHub Actions Workflow**

```
name: Deploy CloudFormation Stack

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - feature/cloudformationstack

env:
  AWS_REGION: "us-east-1"  #Change to your desired AWS regionS

permissions:
  id-token: write   #This is required for requesting the JWT 
  contents: read    # This is required for actions/checkout 

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Configure AWS credentials and Assume Role
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::958686716208:role/Github  # Change to reflect your IAM roleâ€™s ARN
          role-session-name: GitHub_to_AWS_via_FederatedOIDC
          aws-region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}

      - name: Deploy CloudFormation stack
        run: |

          aws cloudformation deploy \
            --template-file template.yml \
            --stack-name event-sqs \
            --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```
name: Specifies the name of the workflow as "Deploy CloudFormation Stack."

on: Specifies that the workflow should run on a push event to the specified branch (feature/cloudformationstack).

env: Sets the AWS region to "us-east-1."

permissions: Specifies permissions required for the workflow, such as read access for repository contents and write access for the ID token.

Jobs
deploy: Configures a job named "deploy" that runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.

steps: Contains the following steps:

Checkout repository: Checks out the repository using GitHub Actions.

Configure AWS credentials and Assume Role: Configures AWS credentials and assumes the specified IAM role.

Deploy CloudFormation stack: Uses the AWS CLI to deploy the CloudFormation stack defined in template.yml with specified parameters.

Note:
You need to replace placeholders like **arn:aws:iam::958686716208:role/Github** with your actual values, such as the IAM role ARN and AWS region.

The GitHub Actions workflow is triggered only for pushes to the feature/cloudformationstack branch.

The CloudFormation stack is deployed with the aws cloudformation deploy command, specifying the template file, stack name, and capabilities.

Overall, this template automates the deployment of an AWS infrastructure for handling custom events using EventBridge and SQS.
